# Introduction

## What is Azure?

Azure -> Microsoft's cloud computing platform. 

### How does Azure works?

- uses virtualization: hypervisor as an abstraction layer between hardware and OS.

### What is cloud computing?

- delivery of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Like renting compute power and storage from someone else's data center.

### Why should I move to the cloud?

Helps move faster and innovate better. Two new trends:

- teams delivering new features to users at record speed
- End user expect increasingly rich and immersive experience with their devices and software

From updates every month/year to CD. New interactions with devices: face recognition, voice command, AR, etc. What the cloud offers:

- nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage and networking components
- speech recognition and other cognitive services so that your application stands out from the crowd
- analytics services to use telemetry data coming back from your software and devices

### What can I do on Azure?

Over 100 services from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality

Many teams start by moving their existing applications to VM on Azure. The cloud offers more than that: AI, machine learning services, dynamic storage solutions. Enable solutions that are not possible otherwise.

## Tour of Azure services

Different categories:

1. Compute Services
  - VMs
  - containers
  - serverless computing
2. Cloud storage
  - discs attached to VMs
  - fileshare
  - DBs
3. Networking
  - private networks to on prem
4. App hosting
  - PaaS on windows or Linux
  - Marketplace with 3rd party solutions
5. AI
  - uses data to predict future
6. IoT
  - integrates sensors and devices
7. Integration
  - Server bus
8. Security
  - into every aspect of Azure

## Exercise - Create a website hosted in Azure

### What is an App Service?

HTTP-based services that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure.

### What is the Microsoft Azure Marketplace?

Online store that hosts applications that are certified and optimized to run in Azure. From AI + machine learning to web apps.

### Creating resources in Azure

First thing to do is to create a resource group to hold all the things that we need to create. Allows us to administer all the services, disks, network interfaces, etc.

## Exercise - Configure an app service

### What is scale?

Scale refers to adding network bandwidth, memory, storage or compute power to achieve better performance.

## Exercise - Access an App Service using Azure Cloud Shell

### What is Azure Cloud Shell?

Browser based cli experience for managing and developing Azure resourcs.
