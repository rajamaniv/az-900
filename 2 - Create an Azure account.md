## Understand Azure billing

You only pay for what you use, with a monthly invoice.

### Azure subscription

When you sign up, an Azure subscription is created by default. Azure subscription: logical container used to provision resources in Azure. Holds the details of all resources like VM, DB, and more. When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to.

### Create additional Azure subscription

You can create additional subscriptions to separate:

- Environments: separate dev, testing, isolate data for compliance reasons. Resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
- Organizational structures: limit resources by teams for exemple.
- Biling: costs are first aggregated at the subscription level, so helps manage and track costs based on your needs.
- Subscriptions limits: There are some hard limits per subscriptions, so to go over them you need more subscriptions

### Customize billing to meet your needs

You can consolidate Azure subscriptions into invoice sections, then into biling profile, then into biling account.
